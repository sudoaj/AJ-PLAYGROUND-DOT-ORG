React Server Components (RSCs) are an exciting new feature that allows developers to build applications that span the server and client, combining the rich interactivity of client-side apps with the performance of traditional server rendering.

### Advantages of Server Components:

*   **Zero Bundle Size:** Server Components don't send any JavaScript to the client, reducing bundle sizes and improving initial load times.
*   **Direct Backend Access:** They can directly access server-side resources like databases and file systems without needing to build an API.
*   **Automatic Code Splitting:** Client Components imported by Server Components are automatically code-split.
*   **Improved Performance:** By moving rendering logic to the server, RSCs can reduce the amount of work done on the client, leading to faster applications.
