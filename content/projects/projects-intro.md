# Welcome to the Projects Section!

This is where I showcase a variety of projects—some big, some small, all built with curiosity and a love for learning. Here’s what you can expect:

- **A blend of blog and tutorial:** For each project, I’ll break down how it’s made, step by step, so you can follow along or remix it for your own use.
- **Project curation:** If a project is especially cool or useful, it’ll graduate to the Playground. Otherwise, it lives here as a resource and inspiration.
- **Interlinked content:** Some projects will have dedicated blog posts for deeper dives, and you’ll find links between them for easy exploration.
- **Exciting times ahead:** I’m always experimenting, so expect new ideas, fresh tutorials, and honest write-ups about what works (and what doesn’t).
