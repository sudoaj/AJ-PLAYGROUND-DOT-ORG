# **App Name**: AJ-Playground

## Core Features:

- Global Navigation: Display a sticky navigation bar with links to Resume, Projects, and Blog.
- GitHub Project Integration: Fetch and display project information from GitHub using the GitHub API, including project title, description, dates, technologies used, and a link to the repository. Dynamically update project information from Github.
- AI Project Assistant: Implement an AI assistant (AJ-GPT) that can answer questions about AJ's projects by querying project data and responding in natural language. The tool should be able to parse project titles, descriptions, and technologies to provide relevant answers.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary background color: Dark gray/black (e.g., #1A1A1A).
- Text color: Light gray/white for readability on dark backgrounds.
- Accent color: Use vibrant blue (#29ABE2) for highlights and interactive elements.
